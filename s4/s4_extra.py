# Extra questions for session 4:
# 1. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list.
# e.g. for the list nums = [10,32,12,11,9] we should get an output of 74
# 2. Write a Python program to count the number of strings where the string length is 2
# e.e for the list words = ['hi', 'hello', 'no', 'is'] should give an output of 3
# 3. Given the following dictionary:
# inventory = {
#   'gold' : 500,
#   'pouch' : ['flint', 'twine', 'gemstone'],
#   'backpack' : ['xylophone','dagger', 'bedroll','bread loaf']
# }
# Try to do the followings
# a. Add a key to inventory called ‘pocket’.
# b. Set the value of ‘pocket’ to be a list consisting of the strings ‘seashell’, ‘strange berry’, and ‘lint’
# c. Add 50 to the number stored under the ‘gold’ key.
