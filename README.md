# cfg-python

This is a repo for CFG python course (Sept - Nov 2020).

The project folder contains my final submission for the end-of-course project, for which I created a dog breed recommendation programme. The code pulls data from The Dog API, and based on individual breed's characteristics, recommends you a breed based on the information you provide. At the end, your recommended breed(s) are saved to a csv file alongside a picture of your dream dog.
